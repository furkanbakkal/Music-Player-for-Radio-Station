# Music-Player-for-Radio-Station

Automatic and Timed Music Player Project for Radio Station:

Paths of playlists are written in "time.csv" by day and time. In the "settings.log" file, features such as repeating songs or resuming after a power outage can be controlled.

When the main code is run, the first song on the specified day and time starts playing according to the current time zone. When the song ends, it automatically switches to the next. When the specified time comes, the playlist folder changes and continues from the specified list.

Playlists and switch times in "time.csv" are dynamically encoded.
